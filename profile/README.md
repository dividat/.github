We make a **small game console with a large controller** for cognitive-motor training.

We are pragmatic users of functional programming languages (Elm, OCaml, Rust, Scala, Nix) and anything else we find useful for creating robust and maintainable systems.

If you ended up here through one of our open source projects and think this could be interesting for you, send us an email!
